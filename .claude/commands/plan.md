Create an implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Use "think hard" to reason through this carefully.

**DO NOT write code yet.**

Steps:
1. Review exploration findings (run /explore first if needed)
2. Identify all files that need changes
3. Consider multiple approaches if applicable
4. Choose approach with rationale
5. Break into incremental, safe-to-rollback steps

Output format:

## Summary
[One paragraph overview]

## Approach
[Chosen approach with brief rationale]

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step with specific file paths]
2. [Step with specific changes]
...

## Testing Strategy
[How to verify each step]

## Rollback Plan
[How to undo if needed]
